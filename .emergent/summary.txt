The trajectory outlines the transition of a software engineering task from an AI engineer to a human expert. The initial AI engineer was tasked with analyzing an existing application (Value Number™), a website (valuenumber.info), and a Next.js codebase, then implementing user-prioritized enhancements. The AI successfully navigated initial setup, codebase exploration (choosing the React/FastAPI stack over Next.js), and incrementally built out features across four phases. Significant effort was dedicated to precisely replicating the visual design and animations (especially the SCI™ branding and rotating atom) from reference websites, often requiring multiple iterations and troubleshooting. A critical bug related to passcode validation was identified and fixed in the backend. The work culminated in significant UI/UX improvements, functional calculator, and authentication mechanisms, with continuous integration of user feedback for design accuracy and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The user provided a detailed problem statement for the Value Number™ application, aiming to transform it into a more functional, user-friendly, and attractive MVP.
The core problem Value Number™ addresses is the .3 trillion global cost of poor decision-making by providing a quantifiable methodology. It uses proprietary formulas (S and W) and Synthetic Cumulative Intelligence (SCI™) for decision analysis across various sectors. The application was initially in private beta, accessed via a passcode.

Key features implemented or requested:
1.  **Value Number Calculator™:** Core functionality involving S and W formulas, input for time, effort, and cost, real-time calculation, and recommendations. This also included smart validation, history tracking, export features, scenario modeling, and AI insights.
2.  **User Authentication & Management:** An invitation system with a specific passcode (VN-2025-GO), social login, role-based access, profile management, and team collaboration capabilities.
3.  **Admin Dashboard & Content Management:** A functional admin panel for managing users, content, analytics, and system settings.
4.  **World-Class Visual Design & Modern UI Overhaul:**
    *   Mirroring the exact style, format, colors, and animations of  and , specifically for the animated SCI™ POWERED by Emergent Solutions banner with a rotating atom.
    *   Replacing all SCI acronyms with SCI™ and Synthetic Cumulative Intelligence with Synthetic Cumulative Intelligence™.
    *   Enhancing header/footer visibility, adding Privacy, Legal, and Testimonials sections.
    *   Refining calculator visuals (removing borders, adding gradients).
    *   Adjusting paragraph formatting (3 lines, no single words).
    *   Darkening background shades and enhancing neon glow/pulsating gradient effects for the SCI™ banner.
